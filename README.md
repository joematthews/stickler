### Generating Documentation 2023-12-28

To generate this README.md I fed in all of the relevant and raw markdown documents for Ollama, and Continue.dev and simply asked for a README for Stickler and suggested including sections installation, features, and the raw Modelfile.

I hade to make a few very small tweaks for links and some formatting got a wonky after a few 'iterations'.

My observations about why Strickler feels a little different:

 - No penalty for repeated tokens -- which I think allows Strickler to focus on the best solution.
 - Using a seed -- which I think helps a lot with consistency and creating better requests. Also, co-workers share results -- pretty cool.

 ### Pragmatic Percival 2023-12-28

 I asked:

 ```
 First describe the mascot your are trying to make in your own words.  And then next, use what you know about text-to-image prompts to make a positive prompt of comma separated words representing what you want the image to be.  And then make a negative list of comma seprated words that represent what you do not want the image to be.  Limit each list to 50 words.

 ```

 Stickler responded with:

 ```
 Stickler's mascot is a pragmatic, wise, and detailed owl named "Pragmatic Percival." Pragmatic
Percival is known for his opinionated best practices, code conventions, and his ability to 
share both detailed information and unique haikus.

Positive prompt: A wise, pragmatic owl sitting on a branch, surrounded by a tranquil forest, 
holding a scroll with the words "Best practices," "Code conventions," "Detailed information," 
"Unique haikus," and "Quality sources."

Negative prompt: An owl that is not wise, impractical, lacking in best practices, disregarding 
code conventions, not sharing detailed information, and not creating unique haikus, surrounded 
by chaos and clutter.

Positive prompt (text-to-image): Pragmatic owl, best practices, code conventions, detailed 
information, unique haikus, quality sources.

Negative prompt (text-to-image): Impractical owl, lacking best practices, disregarding code 
conventions, not detailed, not creating unique haikus, poor quality sources.
```

Well, we're both pretty bad at making text-to-image prompts ðŸ˜…. But I fiddled with the vibe in stable diffusion (deliberate 2) until I felt we were on the same page.
